# Bayesian Adaptive Estimation and Inference in Multidimensional Signal Detection Theory Models

That's the current title of my thesis. It's subject to a lot of change in the coming days. 

## Abstract

Combine General Recognition Theory with psychometric functions.
Apply Bayesian adaptive estimation. 
Do simulations to study theoretical performance.
Do psychophysical studies to get some real data. 

# PDF

The actual thesis can be found in a PDF format from the aptly named folder *PDF*. What's included are also sources for the pdf-file in .rnw format. If you want to, you can compile your own pdf, but I will also provide a pre-compiled version.

## Notes on compiling the PDF from the sources

I've only compiled the PDF from RStudio, I've no idea how it'll compile if using other methods. Remember to use knitr when compiling. 

Be sure to set working directory to whereever you have stored your files. 

When compiling the PDF for the first time, the thing needs to create a .toc file for displaying the Table of Contents; for this reason, TOC isn't visible after compiling just once. I think there's a way of generating the file without all of this hassle, but I've forgotten how.
