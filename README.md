# Bayesian Adaptive Estimation and Inference in Multidimensional Signal Detection Theory Models

That's the current title of my thesis. It's subject to a lot of change in the coming days. 

## Abstract

Combine General Recognition Theory with psychometric functions.
Apply Bayesian adaptive estimation. 
Do simulations to study theoretical performance.
Do psychophysical studies to get some real data.
